\cmucl{} includes a partial implementation of \emph{Simple Streams}, a
protocol that allows user-extensible streams\footnote{This
implementation was donated by Paul Foley}. The protocol was proposed
by Franz, Inc. and is intended to replace the \emph{Gray Streams}
method of extending streams. Simple streams are distributed as a
\cmucl{} subsystem, that can be loaded into the image by saying

\begin{lisp}
   (require :simple-streams)
\end{lisp}

Note that CMUCL's implementation of simple streams is incomplete, and
in particular is currently missing support for the functions
\code{read-sequence} and \code{write-sequence}. Please consult the
\textit{Allegro Common Lisp} documentation for more information on
simple streams.
