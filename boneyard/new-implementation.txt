old memory layout
=================

The third lowest bit in pointers is used by the garbage
collector. When garbage collection is not in progress, it is zero.

Pointers use the low two bits for flags. The rest is for the address
bits.  Flag bits 00 are for immediates. 01 are for conses. 02 are for
boxed objects. 03 are for strings and doubles.

The immediate with all bits zero is NIL.

The immediates with the bit pattern ...ccc11000 are characters.  The
character unicode code point is contained in the next higher bits.

The immediates with the bit pattern ...iii10000 are fixnums.  The
highest bit is the sign bit, and the representation is two's
complement.

Conses are two slots long.  The first slot is the CAR and the second
slot is the CDR.

The second slot of a boxed object has the third lowest bit set. This
is a reliable boxed object start marker when garbage collection is not
in progress.  The eight low bits of the first slot are used for flags.
The high bits are the length of the object, in slots, minus two.  The
second slot is a type indicator for the object. 212: function 20:
symbol 116: array 180: package Otherwise the type indicator is a class
object.
